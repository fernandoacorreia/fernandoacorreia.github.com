{% img right /images/Fernando_128x128.png %}

I'm Brazilian, 42 years old. I've been developing software for over 25 years. Currently I work as a software architect
developing reusable components for software-as-a-service products.

I've worked with a lot of tools and technologies. At the moment I'm mainly using C# and developing for the Azure
platform. I'm also using JavaScript for browser applications and some Java for services.
