Today I was reading a few more articles about the experience of using static pages instead of a dynamic engine
to host a blog or a content site. One quote caught my attention:

{% blockquote Young Hahn http://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/09/09/jekyll-github-pages/ Using Jekyll and GitHub Pages for Our Site %}
There are no entry points to hack and there is no live webapp to go down.
{% endblockquote %}

Static sites are worry-free. It's a whole lot less surface area with potential
vulnerabilities. It's one less piece of software to worry about security patches. It's one less vector of attack.

For the sake of security, I don't usually host a blog on the same server I have other stuff I care about.
But I might host a static site.

In this sense, using Octopress for my blog can make my life simpler.
