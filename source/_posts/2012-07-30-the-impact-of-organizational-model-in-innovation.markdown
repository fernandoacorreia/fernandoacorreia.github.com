Throughout my career I've been part of several innovation projects focused on applying emerging technologies to bring
new or improved products to the market. One recent example, still ongoing, is leveraging cloud computing to develop
cost-effective software-as-a-service offerings for the SMB (small and medium businesses) market segment.

The business management software is undergoing a deep change from monolithic, massive products that enforce rigid
business processes and are sold for costly up-front licensing fees towards more specialized, streamlined and flexible
solutions offered as a service and billed according to usage.

David Yarnold speaks of this trend:

SAP’s walls are beginning to crumble, their armor is getting weak and cloud-based enterprise applications are no longer just for small businesses.
{% endblockquote %}

While small startups and more established new companies such as Workday and Salesforce.com are quickly innovating and
increasing their market share from the bottom up, traditional companies are slower, sometimes rehashing their
legacy products and offering them as hosted services.

One of the reasons is that incumbent companies are optimized for catering to their existing customer base and for
sustainable innovation, while disruptive innovation requires a different mindset and orientation.

{% blockquote Clayton M. Christensen and Michael E. Raynor http://www.amazon.com/The-Innovators-Solution-Sustaining-Successful/dp/1578518520 The Innovator's Solution %}
Established companies have the resources — the engineers, money, and technology — required to succeed at both sustaining and disruptive technologies. But their processes and values constitute disabilities in their efforts to succeed at disruptive innovation.
{% endblockquote %}

So the lesson I take is that, at this point, business management software companies need to apply distinct processes and values
to their disruptive innovation projects, or face being disrupted themselves.
