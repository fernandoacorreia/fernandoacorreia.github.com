    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I chose Octopress to publish this blog. When I was reading on how to install it, I learned that it required Ruby 1.9.2.
Octopress' documentation recommends installing it through a Ruby environment manager: either RVM or rbenv.</p>

<p>The last time I was dabbling with Ruby was a few years ago, before these tools were introduced. So I didn't have a
favorite to pick. To choose one I
searched Google, read a little bit and came to the conclusion that rbenv is lighter and possibly simpler, while RVM
is more complex and more powerful. I'm not developing in Ruby so light and simple suits me. At the same time, RVM
messes with the builtin <code>cd</code> command and I'd rather leave it alone. So I picked rbenv.</p>

<p>Ubuntu has has a rbenv package, so I went for it first. I quickly had rbenv running but when I tried to install the
ruby-build rbenv plugin I couldn't get it to work. I could have used an alternate route to install ruby-build
but I prefer the path of less resistance. I don't like fighting the tools.</p>

<p>So I uninstalled Ubuntu's rbenv package (which, by the way, was several versions out-of-date) and did a manual install
of rbenv from its project site.</p>

<p>These are the commands I used to install rbenv in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin):</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3177482.js?file='></script>
<noscript><pre><code># pre-reqs
sudo apt-get install git-core build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev

# rbenv
cd
git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv.git .rbenv
echo 'export PATH=&quot;$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH&quot;' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval &quot;$(rbenv init -)&quot;' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
exec $SHELL

# ruby-build
mkdir -p ~/.rbenv/plugins
cd ~/.rbenv/plugins
git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git

# install some rubies
cd
rbenv install 1.9.2-p290
rbenv install 1.9.2-p320
rbenv install 1.9.3-p194
rbenv rehash

# set a global ruby
rbenv global 1.9.2-p290</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>Installing Ruby takes some time, between a large download and setup, but everything went smoothly and worked as
advertised. A great experience.</p>
